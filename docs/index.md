title: Manifesto

Acid is designing the future.

The future is a second enlightenment of the digital world.

The future is people-powered software, geared for liberation.

Acid does not care who you are, anon.

We do not care about your name, gender, race or nationality. In our world idea = idea and the message is the message. Our utopia is private, modular, decentralised, collective, meaningful.

Donâ€™t forget they are lying to you. The human spirit is not dead, the map is not the territory. We are proof of the power born from discovering together: a nomadic war machine in cyberspace, on a mission to create technology that supports freedom, justice and innovation for all.

We believe no one is free until we are all free, because no one is an island: we are all pieces of the main.

If we are your people, [join us](/join-us).

FREE YOUR MIND - ðŸ™‚
