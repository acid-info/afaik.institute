# Grassroots Community Organizer

[Acid.info](http://Acid.info) is eager to bring a passionate, driven grassroots community organizer onboard to steer our political movement-building operations. Our ideal candidate will nurture our fledgling community of volunteers, core contributors and activists as we embark on our mission to rebuild humanity’s future with liberation-geared, people-powered software.

We’re building a grassroots movement to create technological alternatives to oppressive systems of societal control. Vehemently anti-censorship, anti-surveillance and anti-authoritarian, we support basic human rights via the creation of opt-in alternatives to traditional power structures.

Working alongside experienced activists, our dream candidate is one who firmly aligns with our political and philosophical ethos. We’re not looking for someone that is just “into crypto/web3” but an individual that lives and breathes cypherpunk ideals and shows a passion for disruption through unconventional means. 

### About Acid.info

[Acid.info](http://Acid.info) is a creative design studio within Logos. It serves as the organization’s communications hub and is made up of designers, coders, linguists, dreamers and revolutionaries. The department takes a brutalist approach to the creation process, favoring impactful designs over superfluous detail that risks diluting or warping the overall message.  

### About Logos

Logos emerges from and builds upon the mission undertaken by Status. More overtly political than its predecessor, Logos creates digital infrastructure to emancipate those shut out of global society by oppressive governments, economic circumstances or Big Tech overreach. The collective’s long-term goal is the formation of a network state—a purpose-driven community living within an opt-in alternative system to that of the nation state.
